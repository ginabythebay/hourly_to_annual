# hourly_to_annual
this is a short python program that converts hourly salary to annual salary
I'm back on the python-learning bandwagon and want to create a small program and put it on github for practice. So, one conversion I do using mental math is to quickly calculate annual salary based on the hourly salary. So "x" dollars per doubled then add three zeros at the end "000" to get an approximate annual salary. In other words, $30 dollars per hour is approximately $60,000 per year. Thirty times two is sixty, and make it sixty thousand. This is easier than multipying 30 times 2000 in your head. If you think about it, there are 40 hours in a work week, and approximately 50 weeks per year. 40 * 50 = 2000
Of course, there aren't exactly 50 weeks in a year, and hopefully you get two weeks paid vacation. Also, many people work more than 40 hours a week. 
This new program will multiply the hourly salary or "hourly" times 40 * 52 to get a more accurate annual salary calculation.
